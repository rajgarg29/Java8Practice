Practice Java 8
-----------------------

1.Lambda
---------
package com.garg.lambda contains introduction of predicate and Lambda.

		Most of developer still using same way :-)
 
- I added A, B, C.. prefix in class names so that you can go step by step and see how code is evolving using java8 features Predicates, Functional interFaces and Lambda.
